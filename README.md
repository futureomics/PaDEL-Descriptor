# PaDEL-Descriptor
PaDELPy is a Python wrapper for the Java-based PaDEL-Descriptor software, streamlining molecular descriptor calculations
With PaDELPy, you can easily compute molecular fingerprints, avoiding the complexity of Java setup and reducing the time required for implementation.
PaDEL-Descriptor molecular descriptor calculation software, allowing efficient generation of molecular fingerprints for machine learning-based quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) models in drug discovery.
